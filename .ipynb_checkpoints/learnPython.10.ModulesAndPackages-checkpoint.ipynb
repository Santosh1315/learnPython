    "Packages are namespaces which contain multiple packages and modules themselves. They are simply directories, but with a twist.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each package in Python is a directory which MUST contain a special file called **`__init__.py`**. This file can be empty, and it indicates that the directory it contains is a Python package, so it can be imported the same way a module can be imported.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we create a directory called **foo**, which marks the package name, we can then create a module inside that package called **bar**. We also must not forget to add the **`__init__.py`** file inside the foo directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use the module bar, we can import it in two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "**import foo.bar**\n",
    "\n",
    "or:\n",
    "\n",
    "** from foo import bar **\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first method, we must use the **foo** prefix whenever we access the module **bar**. In the second method, we don't, because we import the module to our module's namespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **`__init__.py`**  file can also decide which modules the package exports as the API, while keeping other modules internal, by overriding the **`__all__`**  variable, like so:\n",

    "This section explains how to use Functions in Python. Functions are a convenient way to divide your code into useful blocks, allowing us to order our code, make it more readable, reuse it and save some time. Also functions are a key way to define interfaces so programmers can share their code.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a Jupyter notebook. It is useful because you can both compose and run code in the same place. This is a \"markdown block\" it is use to provide none code information. The next block is a \"code\" block, it contains runnable python code.\n",

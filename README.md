# learnPython

This project is a set of notebooks to help the beginning learner use python.
These are Jupyter notebooks. It is useful because you can both compose and run code in the same place.

Python is a very simple language, and has a very straightforward syntax. It encourages programmers to program without boilerplate (prepared) code. The simplest directive in Python is the "print" directive - it simply prints out a line (and also includes a newline, unlike in C).

Most of the tuorials are adapted from http://www.learnpython.org. The tutorials were provided by DataCamp. Get started learning Python with DataCamp's free Intro to Python tutorial.
